                    <p>Fred of Fred's Donut Company has been making hot, fresh donuts for the last 60 years. Fred was ready to retire and wanted something to remember his donut making days by.  He came up with the idea of a game
                        that would let himself, and others, continue making his hot, fresh donuts in a virtual factory.  So he contacted his buddy Joe. Joe was a retired programmer that started his career just as the IBM S/360's
                        started to be delivered.  Fred explained to Joe how he wanted a game where you clicked a button to increase your count of donuts, and there were other buttons that let you buy things that increased your count.
                        What Joe, who was getting up there, heard was "Buttons".  He was quite proud when he delivered his virtual Button Making game to Fred.  Fred just looked fondly at his friend, smiled and said, "That's great, Joe.
                        Let's play."</p>
